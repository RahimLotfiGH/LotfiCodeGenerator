# Lotfi Code Generator (LCG)
A Code Generating Program for Three-layer Architecture used for Application and Web Design
<br/>
<b> Abstract</b>
<br/><br/>
Nowadays, most web and application programs are written based on this three-layer architecture. In this article, first this three-layer Architecture is introduced and then a program for generating application and web in an optimized and complete way is introduced.
<br/><br/>
<b>Introduction</b><br/>
This architecture consists of three-layers, including presentation, business, and data. But, with some modifications, an optimal architecture can be obtained. Presentation layer refers to forms and pages which are in fact user interface (UI). Business layer includes functions for establishing relations between data and presentation layers. Data layer refers to the functions which have direct contact with the database.
